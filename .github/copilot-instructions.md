# Structure

Respect the folder structure when creating or modifying any files:

- `/docs` is the root folder for technical documentation, requirements and task lists

# Code structure

- Code files should have a suitable comment wherever appropriate which details the purpose and strucuture of this file
- Code files should never exceed 300 lines long; if any changes will extend a code file to greater than this you should consider restructuring the code

# Quality

All code created should have equivalent unit tests.
